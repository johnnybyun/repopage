      Hi my name is John and I was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, I entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played my entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. I won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, was named the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and was a two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[3][4][5][6] he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.

    </p>

    <p>
      At 34 years and 104 days of age, I became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. I became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. I was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. My 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. My four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, I won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, I won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for my 2017 film Dear Basketball.[7]
